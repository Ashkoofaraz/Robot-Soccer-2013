This repository was created to share the entire RoboCup Junior Soccer robot project,
including Rendering, SolidWorks CAD drawings, simulations, software code and libraries.

The project was developed by team EmeroCHS (Emerotecos with CHS)  from Brazil, for the national and international
RoboCup at Eidhoven.

At the same time, we were developing a Soccer B robot for RoboCup too. They both use almost the same electronics design and concept. Here is the [Rescue B project repository](https://github.com/ivanseidel/Robot-Rescue-2013).
